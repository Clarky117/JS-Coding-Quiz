# JS-Coding-Quiz

Built a dynamic quiz website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br><br>

## Key Points

It is pivotal to be able to show not only the individual skills we learn, but how we get all those key areas to work together. It is all good to be able to code up HTML, then add a bit of CSS on top to make it look nice. However, to then be able to make your website dynamic with Javascript and update the DOM as you click buttons, answer questions, and type inputs, is a real test of skill.<br><br>

## Skills Used

The core of the website uses the HTML and CSS we have learnt over the first 2 weeks giving it structure and adaptable to a wide range of screen sizes.<br><br>

When the user clicks the start button we then dynamically update the DOM using Javascript, a count down timer then starts in the upper right hand corner of the screen, and the user is presented with the first of a series of questions which are displayed one at a time, only updating once the question has been answered.<br><br>

When the user answers a question, we then validate whether the answer is either correct or incorrect, and if the latter, time is deducted from what is remaining.<br><br>

If the users timer reaches 0 presenting no time left, the quiz is ended.<br><br>

When the user answers all questions or the timer reaches 0, the user is presented with a new screen, showing them their score and asking for initials to be submitted to the high score page.<br><br>

Using local storage on the users device via Javascript, they are presented with a high score page unique to their device.<br><br>

The user then has the ability to either wipe the high scores from local storage, or return to the main menu via the 2 buttons displayed on that page.<br><br>

## Site Visuals

## Things i want to work on

Javascript! What can i say? It is proving to be such a powerful language, the more time spent using it the more doors it seems to open in what i can actually code. Being as open ended as it is, i would like to spend more time honing my skills and become less reliant on google for which concepts i should be using in which areas. I find at times i can confuse myself with the variables i create and getting them all to talk to each other, but being such an integral part of making a website dynamic i am sure things will ease in the future.<br><br>
